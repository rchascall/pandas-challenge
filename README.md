Pandas Challenge Assignment Written Report

Top & Bottom Performing School Analysis
The data show that the lowest peformng schools are those with larger student populations.  Analyzing the data show that the Top five performing schools all have student populations less than those of the bottom five performing schools.

Grouped Scores by Grade Analysis
The data show that from grade nine to twelve, there is no marked improvement in grades.  The grades that are earned by the students when in grade nine, do not appear to improve but rather remain consistent throughout their high school years.

Scores by School Spending Analysis
The data show that the schools with the lower per-student budget (< $585 per student) perform better than those schools with higher per-student budgets.  Perhaps the lower spending schools are more efficient and aware of the need to function at a lower cost.

Schools by Size Analysis
While the analysis above appears to show that the lower performing schools are those with larger populations, the Schools by Size analysis appears to suport this while also showing the medium sized schools also perform better than the larger schools.  One could posit that school populations of both small and medium sizes (up to a population of 2,000) consistently outpeform schools with populations of greater than 2,000.

Schools by School Type Analysis
The data show that Charter schools perform better than district schools across both math and reading and greatly in overall passing.  Additional analysis of other data points would likely be fruitful in looking for some root causes of this disparity.
